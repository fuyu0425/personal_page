I am a CS PhD student supervised by Prof. [Taesoo Kim](http://taesoo.kim/) in the [SSLab](http://gts3.org/) at Georgia Tech.

My research interests include software security, software verification, and software engineering. More generally, I care about the security and correctness of software.


Before joing Georgia Tech, I was a research assitant at Acaedmia Sinica, the top research institute in Taiwan. I got my bechalor degree in computer science from National Chiao Tung University.
